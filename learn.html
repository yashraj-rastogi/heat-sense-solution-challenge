            <h2>1. Understanding Fire Basics</h2>
            <h3>The Fire Triangle</h3>
            <p>A fire needs three elements to start and sustain: <strong>Heat</strong>, <strong>Fuel</strong>, and <strong>Oxygen</strong>. Removing any one of these elements will extinguish the fire.</p>

            <h3>Classes of Fires</h3>
            <p>Fires are classified based on the type of material that is burning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Class A:</strong> Ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, and plastic.</li>
                <li><strong>Class B:</strong> Flammable liquids and gases like oil, gasoline, and propane.</li>
                <li><strong>Class C:</strong> Electrical fires involving energized electrical equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Class D:</strong> Combustible metals such as magnesium and titanium.</li>
                <li><strong>Class K (or F):</strong> Cooking oils and fats, like vegetable or animal oils, typically found in kitchens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Causes of Fires in Hotels</h3>
            <p>Be aware of potential fire hazards such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrical faults in wiring or appliances.</li>
                <li>Cooking accidents, especially in staff kitchens or unauthorized cooking in guest rooms.</li>
                <li>Unattended candles or smoking in non-smoking areas.</li>
                <li>Improper storage of flammable materials like cleaning supplies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Fire Extinguishers</h2>
            <h3>Types of Fire Extinguishers</h3>
            <p>Different extinguishers are designed for different classes of fires:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Extinguishers:</strong> Suitable for Class A fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Foam Extinguishers:</strong> Effective on Class A and B fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Chemical Extinguishers:</strong> Can be used on Class A, B, and C fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers:</strong> Best for Class B and C fires, often used around electrical equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Wet Chemical Extinguishers:</strong> Specifically designed for Class K (or F) fires in kitchens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Identifying the Right Extinguisher</h3>
            <p>Always check the label on the fire extinguisher to ensure it is the correct type for the fire you are trying to extinguish. Look for the class of fire indicated on the label (e.g., A, B, C, K).</p>

            <h3>How to Use a Fire Extinguisher (P.A.S.S. Method)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pull</strong> the pin.</li>
                <li><strong>Aim</strong> the nozzle at the base of the fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Squeeze</strong> the lever slowly and evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Sweep</strong> the nozzle from side to side at the base of the fire until the fire is out.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Location and Inspection</h3>
            <p>Know the location of fire extinguishers on your floor and in your work areas. Regularly check that extinguishers are in their designated places and have not been tampered with.</p>

            <h2>3. Fire Alarm Systems</h2>
            <h3>Types of Fire Detection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smoke Detectors:</strong> These devices sense smoke in the air and trigger the alarm.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat Detectors:</strong> These activate when the temperature in a room rises rapidly or reaches a certain level.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Pull Stations:</strong> These are located at various points and allow anyone to manually activate the fire alarm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recognizing and Responding to the Fire Alarm</h3>
            <p>Familiarize yourself with the sound of the hotel's fire alarm. When you hear it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investigate:</strong> If it is safe to do so, try to determine the location and nature of the potential fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Evacuate:</strong> If a fire is confirmed, or if instructed by management or the alarm system, begin the evacuation process immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Report:</strong> Report the situation to your supervisor or call the emergency number.</li>

            <h3>Do Not Tamper</h3>
            <p>Tampering with fire alarm systems is dangerous and illegal. Never disable or cover smoke detectors or pull stations.</p>

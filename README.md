## Overview

This web application was developed as a team project for a hackathon to address the challenges of traditional fire safety training for hotel staff members. Our solution provides an engaging and interactive learning experience through **scenario-based training**.

Instead of passive learning, users are presented with realistic fire safety scenarios within a hotel environment. They must make critical decisions, and the application dynamically progresses the scenario based on their choices.

## Key Features

* **Scenario-Based Learning:** Presents users with realistic fire safety situations requiring decision-making.
* **Interactive Decision Points:** Users are prompted to make choices that influence the scenario's progression.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** After each decision, users receive immediate feedback on the correctness and potential consequences of their actions.
* **Branching Narratives:** The scenario evolves differently based on the user's choices, showcasing various outcomes.
* **Success/Failure Endings:** Each scenario concludes with a clear outcome, indicating whether the user successfully navigated the situation or not.
* **Built on Google IDX:** Developed using the Google IDX platform, leveraging its features for a streamlined development experience.
* **Technology Stack:** Built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

1.  The user starts with a fire safety scenario.
2.  They are presented with a situation and a set of possible actions.
3.  Upon selecting an action, the application updates the scenario based on that choice.
4.  The user receives feedback explaining the outcome of their decision and its impact on the situation.
5.  The scenario continues with new challenges and decision points until a final outcome (success or failure in managing the fire safety situation) is reached.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to provide a more effective and engaging alternative to traditional fire safety training methods. By allowing hotel staff to actively participate in simulated scenarios and experience the consequences of their decisions in a safe environment, we aim to:

* Improve understanding of fire safety protocols.
* Enhance decision-making skills in emergency situations.
* Increase retention of critical safety information.
* Provide a more interactive and memorable learning experience.

## Built With

* **HTML:** For structuring the web application's content.
* **CSS:** For styling the user interface and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For implementing the interactive logic, scenario progression, and feedback mechanisms.
* **Google IDX:** As the development platform, providing a streamlined environment for building and potentially deploying the application.

## Team Members 

* Yashraj Rastogi 
* Ananya Yadav

## Future Enhancements 

* Add an AI chatbot for solving doubts about fire safety things.
* Add account system and intregate database (Firebase) 
* Implement more diverse and complex scenarios.
* Track user progress and provide performance metrics based on gamified points system.
* Integrate multimedia elements (images, audio).
* Potentially explore deployment options for wider accessibility.

Thank you for checking out our Fire Safety Training Web Application! We developed this project with the aim of making fire safety training more engaging and effective for hotel staff. We welcome any feedback or suggestions.
